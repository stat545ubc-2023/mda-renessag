# STAT 545A Mini Data Analysis

### Description  
This repository contains the files and code authored by Renessa Gomes as submission for the **STAT 545A Mini Data Analysis** project. The guidelines and requirements for **Milestone 1** of this project can be found [**here**](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-1/). The purpose of Milestone 1 is to explore a dataset using `dplyr` to manipulate and visualize data. The analysis should investigate a clear research question and be presented in a reproducible format. The dataset selected for this analysis was the `cancer_sample` dataset contained in the `datateachr` package.

### Files in the Repository  
This repository contains the following files:  
* `README.md` : introduction and guide to this repository  
* `mini-project-1.Rmd` : milestone 1 assignment guidelines and completed analysis  
* `mini-project-1.md` : knit output file and most up-to-date version of `mini-project-1.Rmd`

### Running the Code  
The following packages are required to run the code in `mini-project-1-Rmd` and may need to be installed:  
* `datateachr` : contains the datasets for analysis  
* `tidyverse` : contains `dplyr` for data wrangling and `ggplot2` for data visualization  
* `ggpubr` : an extension of `ggplot2` that enables multi-plot layouts for data visualization
